<h1>Approximation Theory for Continuous Operators and its Application to the Operator Learning Problem</h1>
<p>
This is my master's thesis, supervised by <a href="https://federicofuentes.github.io/" target="_blank">Ph.D. Federico Fuentes Caycedo</a>.

The usual treatment of operator learning focuses on the amount and quality of
training data to maximize identification in the least number of epochs. The
objective of this document is to complement the literature by reviewing the
theory underlying operator approximation, validating error estimates with
numerical experiments and extracting features from approximants. Through the
review, we formalized incomplete and unclear proofs, extended results, and
propose nuanced questions to guide future research.
